      <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs start with the foundation. Git is a version control system that
        helps you keep track of changes in your files and collaborate with
        others. It manages the history of your code and makes it easier to
        combine updates from different people working on the same project. At
        this stage, terms like version control, branches, or merges may sound
        new, but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîwe‚Äôll gradually break them down in this tutorial.
      </p>
      <h4>Git vs. GitHub</h4>
      <p>Although they sound similar, Git and GitHub are not the same thing.</p>
      <h4>What is Version Control?</h4>
      <p>
        A version control system (VCS) keeps track of every change you make in
        your project. It allows you to go back to earlier versions if needed and
        makes collaboration simple. You can think of it like checkpoints in a
        video game‚Äîyou can always return to a saved state if something goes
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Git, developers relied on older tools like SCCS (Source Code
        Control System). SCCS was expensive and hard to use. Later, other
        systems like CVS, Subversion (SVN), and Perforce were created. Git was
        designed to be faster, more flexible, and accessible for everyone‚Äîand
        that‚Äôs why it became the industry standard.

      <h3>Terminology</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Check git version</h4>
      <pre><code>
        git --version
      </code></pre>
      <h4>Repository</h4>
      <p>
        A repository is a special folder that stores your code and project
        files. It can have files, folders, and even other repositories inside
        it. Think of it as a container that keeps everything for your project in
        one place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software is installed on your system, but Git tracks changes in a
        specific folder. To check the current state of your repository, run this
        command:

      <p>Joins are used to combine rows from multiple tables:</p>
      <pre><code>
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
