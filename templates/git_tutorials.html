      <!-- Git vs GitHub -->
      <article class="doccontentbox" id="git-github">
        <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Git</b> is a free software you install on your computer (Windows,
          macOS, or Linux) to track changes in your files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GitHub</b> is like Google Drive for Git projects. You can upload
          your code online, share it with others, and work together as a team.
          GitHub is the most popular option, but there are other similar
          platforms too, like GitLab, Bitbucket, and SourceForge.
        </p>
        <h3>Why use Git?</h3>
        <p>
          Git is like a smart notebook that saves every draft of your work.
          Imagine writing a book‚ÄîGit lets you save each version so you can go
          back if you make a mistake. When working in a team, everyone writes
          their part on separate copies (<b>branches</b>) and later combines
          them into one final version (<b>merge</b>). In this tutorial, we‚Äôll
          learn these ideas step by step in a simple way.
        </p>

      <!-- Version Control -->
      <article class="doccontentbox" id="vcs">
        <h3>Version Control System</h3>
        <p>
          Version control systems are like a ‚Äútime machine‚Äù for your code. They
          let you save different versions of your work, go back if you make a
          mistake, and work together with others. Think of it like
          <b>checkpoints in a video game</b>‚Äîyou can always return to an earlier
          point if something goes wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Git, developers used older systems like
          <b>SCCS, CVS, SVN, and Perforce</b>. But SCCS was expensive and hard
          to use. Git was later created to make version control free, easy, and
          accessible for everyone, which is why it‚Äôs so popular today.

      <!-- Setup Git and GitHub -->
      <article class="doccontentbox" id="setup">
        <h3>Setup Git and GitHub</h3>

        <p>
          <b>Git installation:</b>
          You can either use the command line or download it from the official
          website. Git works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
            >Download Git here</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Creating an account on GitHub</b>
          is another important step.
          <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> offers free
          accounts for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>To push (upload) code to GitHub:</b> You need to set up
          <b>SSH keys</b>. This provides a secure way to log in without entering
          your password every time. Since GitHub no longer allows password
          login, SSH key setup is required.
        </p>

      <!-- Terminology -->
      <article class="doccontentbox" id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Repository(Repo):</b>
          A folder that Git is tracking. Like a project folder on your computer
          where all versions are saved.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Commit:</b>
          A saved snapshot of your work. Like pressing ‚ÄúSave‚Äù in a video game or
          saving a draft of your essay.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Branch:</b>
          An alternative timeline of your project. Like writing a ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù
          version of a story without changing the main one.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Merge:</b>
          Combining changes from different branches into one. Like friends
          writing different chapters of a book and then putting them together.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Clone:</b>
          Copying a repository from GitHub to your computer. Like downloading a
          Google Drive folder to your laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Push:</b>
          Sending your changes from your computer to GitHub. Like uploading
          files from your PC to Google Drive.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Pull:</b>
          Getting the latest changes from GitHub to your computer. Like
          downloading the latest version of a shared Google Doc.
        </p>

        <p><b>Stash:</b></p>

        <b>Check your git version</b><br />
        <span class="run-guide"
          >To check your Git version, run this command in your terminal or
          command prompt:</span
        >
        <pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
        <b>Config Settings</b><br />
        <span>
          Git lets you set up basic information like your username and email,
          which are saved in a config file. These details are added to every
          commit you make so others know who made the changes. You can set
          global settings that apply to all projects or repository-specific
          settings for just one project. It‚Äôs best to use the same username and
          email as your GitHub account when configuring Git. </span
        ><br /><br />
        <span>
          Let‚Äôs set up your email and username in Git‚Äôs config file. It‚Äôs
          recommended to create a GitHub account first and then use the same
          email and username from your account. This way your commits will be
          properly linked to your GitHub profile. </span
        ><br />
        <span class="run-guide"
          >To set your email, use this command (replace it with the email you
          use to log in to GitHub):</span
        >
        <pre><code>git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"</code></pre>
        <span class="run-guide"
          >Set your username with this command (replace it with your GitHub
          username):</span
        >
        <pre><code>git config --global user.name "username"</code></pre>
        <span class="run-guide"
          >Now you can check your config settings by running this command in
          your terminal or command prompt:</span
        >
        <pre><code>git config --list</code></pre>
        <b>Repository</b><br />
        <span>
          A repository (repo) is like a special folder on your computer that not
          only stores your files and folders but also keeps track of every
          change you make. Imagine working on a school project‚Äîyour folder holds
          all chapters, images, and notes, but with Git as a repository, it also
          remembers every version, like a diary of changes. You can think of it
          as a CCTV camera for your folder, recording who changed what and when. </span
        ><br/><br/>
        <span class="run-guide"
          >To see the current state of your repository at any time, you can run
          the command:</span
        >
        <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
